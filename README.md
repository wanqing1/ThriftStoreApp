## My Personal Project

### A Thrift Store


 *Functions and Target Users*
- This application works as a small thrift store where users can upload their items to be sold and browse all items 
currently on sale in the thrift store. Furthermore, one can view the things they have purchased. People who want to buy
second-hand products or sell something they own may use this application.


*"Why is this project of interest to me"*
- I came up with this idea because I like shopping in thrift stores. For those who would like to sell items, uploading
the information of their items will be more convenient and their items could be seen by more people on the app.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add my "almost new" sweater to the thrift store.
- As a user, I want to be able to view what the thrift store is selling right now.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the items I have purchased in the thrift store.
- As a user, I want to be able to save items that I have purchased and all items in the store, if I choose to.
- As a user, I want to be able to load items that I have purchased and all items in the store from file, if I choose to.

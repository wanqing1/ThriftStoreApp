## My Personal Project

### An Online Thrift Store


 *Functions and Target Users*
- This application works as a small thrift store where users can upload their items to be sold and browse all items 
currently on sale in the thrift store. Furthermore, one can view the things they have purchased. People who want to buy
second-hand products or sell something they own may use this application.


*"Why is this project of interest to me"*
- I came up with this idea because I like shopping in thrift stores. I believe lots of people prefer shopping online 
nowadays, so an online thrift store will offer them more choices. Also, for those who would like to sell items, this 
will be more convenient and their items could be seen by more people on the internet. Therefore, I am interested in
working on this project.
